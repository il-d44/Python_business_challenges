    "You're in charge of generating data in a data warehouse based on inputs received from another source. In particular, you've been tasked with handling customer details in the form of generating a username for them based on 2 simple aspects: Their full name and their birth year. Suppose for simplicity that all users only use 1 first name and 1 surname.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you receive from the source is their full name, in a tuple (firstname, lastname) format, and their birth year as an integer. The values accepted are between 1911 and 2010, inclusive. The username generating method is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `firstname`: You only take the first letter, as uppercase\n",
    "- You add an underscore separator\n",
    "- `lastname`: You keep it as it is, except lowercase\n",
    "- `birth_year`: You add the final 2 digits of the birth year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples: `[(Haskell, Covus), 1982]` : The generated username: `H_covus82`\n",
    "\n",
    "`[(Franz, Manzo), 1958]` : The generated username` F_manzo58`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 additional complications.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Sometimes, usernames may overlap. For example **Ana Smith** born in **1990** and **Anastasia Smith** also born in **1990** would both have the username `A_smith90`. To avoid this, the system will send, if needed, an integer value in case the original username was already in the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is: If `A_smith90` was already in the system, you would instead receive the complete input:\n",
    "`[(Anastasia, Smith), 1990, 27]`. Adding *another underscore* in between, this would generate the username: `A_smith90_27`. You need not worry about username duplication, since the input will only send an additional integer (between 0 and 99 inclusive) if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. While the system works as intended, it sometimes shuffles the inputs...\n",
    "\n",
    "You ALWAYS receive 1 tuple of (`firstname`, `lastname`) and 1 *integer* between *1911 - 2010* (and *sometimes* a 3rd element, an *integer* between *0* and *99*) inside a list, but you don't always receive them in the same order. That is, the following inputs are all valid:\n",

    "`[27, (Anastasia, Smith), 1990] `\n",
    "\n",
    "They generate the same username: `A_smith90_27`. The 2 (or 3) inputs are always generated inside a list, always in the tuple-integer (integer) format; except in random order.\n",
