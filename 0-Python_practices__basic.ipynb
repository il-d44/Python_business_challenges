    "# Exercise 1 Solution - Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "The following function `calculator(numbers, operation)` takes a list of numbers and a string indicating the operation as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function calls four subfunctions `sum_calc()`, `subtract_calc()`, `divide_calc()` and `multi_calc()` which do the calculation for the specified operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of this code include: use of recursive functions, loops and error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Breakdown - Recursive Functions\n",
    "A recursive function is a function that calls itself in order to solve a problem, as seen within the return line of `sum_calc()`, which takes a list of numbers as an input and returns their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base Case\n",
    "The base case is essential for stopping the recursion. Without it, the function would keep calling itself indefinitely:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "if not numbers:\n",
    "    return 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "This ensures that when the list is empty, the function stops and returns 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursive Case\n",
    "If the list `numbers` is not empty, the function processes the first element of the list and calls itself with the remaining elements. The recursion continues until the list is empty:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "numbers[0] + sum_calc(numbers[1:])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each recursive call works on a smaller version of the original list, reducing the list by one element at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "`sum_calc([1, 2, 3])`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **1st recursion:** list is non-empty so return `1 + sum_calc([2, 3])`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **2nd recursion:** list is non-empty so return `1 + (2 + sum_calc([3]))`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **3rd recursion:** list is still non-empty so return `1 + (2 + (3 + sum_calc([]))`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **4th recursion:** list is now empty so recursion finishes, return `1 + (2 + (3 + 0)) = 6`\n",
